		<h3>Mission of the Project</h3>
		<p>The refugee crisis is the greatest, most complex humanitarian crises of our generation.
				<br /><br />

		Our mission is to provide an Online Platform to all stakeholders and 
		promote the self-sufficiency of all resettled refugees by helping them access services
		and facilities, educational, and work opportunities. <br /><br />
		We seek to transform refugees socially and economically to become advocates of our community, and
		to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate social support services to improve the living
		conditions and quality of life for resettled refugees.</p>
				<br />

	<h3>Current Situation of the Refugees</h3>
	<p>8.7 million Syrians are predicted to be displaced within the country in 2016, and 4.8 million have sought refuge in other countries since 2011. The UNHCR's latest figures show the crisis is getting worse. Families are moving not to simply better their lives, but to literally save their lives. This is the time that no one in the Ummah can afford to be silent, we as the 
	Unsaars have a responsibility to respond.
	We cannot let the generations to come look back on this time in history and wonder how we sat back and did nothing.
	We cannot sit blindly by as people die, flee for their lives, search for homes, or live in an existence many of us cannot even comprehend.
	We must engage, and we must act now.</p>
